## Introduction

In today's fast-paced financial environment, managing investments efficiently is crucial. This project showcases how microservices can streamline the management of investment portfolios. By leveraging RabbitMQ for message brokering, this architecture promotes scalability and reliability.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of several microservices, each responsible for different aspects of portfolio management. Below are the main components:

- **User Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication.
- **Portfolio Service**: Handles the creation, updating, and retrieval of investment portfolios.
- **Transaction Service**: Manages buy and sell transactions.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users about their portfolio status.

The services communicate with each other via RabbitMQ, ensuring asynchronous processing and a decoupled architecture.

## Technologies

This project employs a variety of technologies:

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the microservices.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for asynchronous communication.
- **CloudAMQP**: Managed RabbitMQ service for cloud deployment.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for persistent storage.
- **JPA & Hibernate**: For object-relational mapping.
- **Spring MVC**: For building web applications.
- **Spring Web**: For RESTful API development.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jonas-sanga/Invest-Portfolio-Microservices.git
   cd Invest-Portfolio-Microservices
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configurations for database and RabbitMQ.

3. **Build the Project**:
   Use Maven to build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Services**:
   Start the services using Docker or your preferred method.

## Usage

After running the services, you can interact with them via the API. The API allows you to manage users, portfolios, and transactions.

### Example Request

To create a new portfolio:

```http
POST /api/portfolio
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": 1,
  "name": "Retirement Fund",
  "investments": [
    {
      "stockSymbol": "AAPL",
      "amount": 10
    },
    {
      "stockSymbol": "GOOGL",
      "amount": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example Response

A successful portfolio creation will return:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "userId": 1,
  "name": "Retirement Fund",
  "investments": [
    {
      "stockSymbol": "AAPL",
      "amount": 10
    },
    {
      "stockSymbol": "GOOGL",
      "amount": 5
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2023-10-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```
